# DeepRepo_MinRNN

Normally, all you have to do is run one by one all the cell, and the two graph available in this github should be computed.

Here are the different models implemented : 
- Pytorch GRU
- HomeMade GRU
- minGRU
- minGRU with Parallel scan
- Pytorch LSTM
- HomeMade LSTM
- minLSTM
- minLSTM with Parallel scan
